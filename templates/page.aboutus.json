And it's our mission to unveil those hidden natural remedies and make them accessible to all who seek a healthier and happier life. <br> <br> The Forbidden Fruit is a bridge between ancient and modern worlds, a native healer and a medical researcher, the rainforest and the city. We believe that ancestral remedies are not an alternative but the foundation of human health. And it is our duty to present them in a modern format, backed by research, clarity, and authenticity.  <br> <br> We work with indigenous harvesters and native herbalists to bring the most potent and authentic remedies to you. Our products come from their native lands, whether it's Batana Oil from the rainforests of Honduras, Sarsaparilla Root from Jamaica, herbs from the Amazon in Brazil, or mineral-rich plants inspired by Dr. Sebi’s knowledge from Africa. This is a direct connection that honors the true origin of ancient wisdom."
